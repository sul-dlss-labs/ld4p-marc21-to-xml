# This utility must be run on a Symphony server
# - sirsi.env and selcatalog are the symphony-specific pieces
# start with latest returned Backstage file
# get records with "it" as title control
# put file into Ckeys directory (currently  /s/SUL/Dataload/LD4P/Ckeys)

# Currently only getting Casalini records
# and currently getting them AFTER Backstage processing, will be able to include URIs in $0
# All this will surely change later....
